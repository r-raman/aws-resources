# Welcome to AWS Resources
This site is a collection of AWS resources from various sources collected over a period of time. The intention is to use it as a quick reference guide or even as a source for the associate level certification exam (developer / solution architect) preparation. 

It is hosted on Github pages: https://r-raman.github.io/aws-resources/

If you would like to contribute and help us keep the documentation up-to-date, we would appreciate it very much. Thank you!
